## 📜 Android Permissions
Make sure the following permissions are added to `AndroidManifest.xml`:
```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECEIVE_BOOT_COMPLETED" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.POST_NOTIFICATIONS" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.SCHEDULE_EXACT_ALARM" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.USE_EXACT_ALARM" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.FOREGROUND_SERVICE" />
```

## 🚨 Troubleshooting
**Scheduled notifications not working in release mode?**
1. Ensure ProGuard rules are updated in `proguard-rules.pro`:
```prolog
-keep class com.dexterous.** { *; }
-keep class io.flutter.plugins.** { *; }
-keep class com.google.gson.** { *; }
-keepclassmembers class * { @Keep *; }
```
2. Add `tz.initializeTimeZones();` before scheduling notifications.
3. Test with `flutter build apk --release` and install on a real device.
